Q1)What is SQLite? Uses of Sqlite. Building and installing SQLite.
Ans-> 
SQLite is a lightweight, serverless, self-contained SQL database engine. 
Unlike traditional database systems like MySQL or PostgreSQL, SQLite doesn’t require a server to run. 
It’s embedded directly into the application that uses it, which makes it easy to set up and use.

Some key features of SQLite:
	1.	Serverless: It doesn't require a separate server or network connection.
	2.	Zero Configuration: No setup or administration is needed.
	3.	Self-contained: Everything is stored in a single file, making it portable.
	4.	ACID-compliant: It supports transactions and ensures data integrity (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability).
	5.	Lightweight: It's designed to be small, fast, and efficient.

Q2)show all commants to install SQLlite?
ans-> 

Step 1: Update the system repositories
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
Step 2: Install SQLite 3
sudo apt install sqlite3
Step 3: Verify the Installation
sqlite3 –version
Step 4: Using SQLite 3
Now that SQLite 3 is installed, you can start using it. To begin working with SQLite, simply type:
sqlite3

Q3)featurs and limitation of SQLlite?

Features of SQLite:
1.Serverless:
    SQLite is embedded directly into the application. It doesn’t require a separate database server or daemon process, which reduces overhead.

2. Zero Configuration:
    There’s no need for complex installation or configuration. You can start using SQLite simply by accessing the database file.

3.Self-contained:
    SQLite databases are stored in a single file, making them very portable. This makes it easy to back up, move, or share the database.

4.Cross-Platform:
    SQLite works on many platforms, including Windows, macOS, Linux, and mobile operating systems (iOS, Android). 
    This makes it ideal for multi-platform applications.
    
5.Lightweight:
    SQLite is designed to be small and fast. The library size is tiny.,and it requires minimal memory to run, which is ideal for mobile and embedded devices.

6.Supports SQL Syntax:
    It supports most of the SQL standards, such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, and JOIN. 
    It also provides features like foreign key constraints (if enabled) and triggers.

Limitations of SQLite:

1.Limited Concurrency:
    While SQLite allows for concurrent reads,"To learn how to use SQLite for creating and managing databases in small applications."
It has limited support for concurrent writes. Only one write operation can happen at a time. 
This is due to the file-locking mechanism. In high-concurrency environments (like large-scale web apps), this can become a bottleneck.

2. Lacks User Management:
    Unlike full-fledged database management systems (DBMS) like MySQL or PostgreSQL, SQLite doesn’t have built-in user management, 
    authentication, or authorization features. Security and access control must be handled at the application level.

3.Limited Support for Advanced Features:
    Some features in larger RDBMS like materialized views, full-text search (though it has basic support), 
    and advanced indexing techniques are either absent or have limited implementation in SQLite.

4. Size Limitations:
    Although SQLite can handle large databases (up to 140 terabytes theoretically), performance can degrade as the database grows significantly,
    especially with large numbers of concurrent writes or complex queries.

5.Lacks Network Support:
    SQLite is designed for local storage, so it’s not intended for distributed or networked environments. 
    You can’t easily run SQLite as a server for remote clients like you can with MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.

6.No Full-Text Search by Default:
    SQLite doesn’t have built-in full-text search by default. However, it provides an extension called FTS5 (Full-Text Search) 
    to implement search functionalities, but it’s not as powerful or efficient as full-text search solutions in other databases.

Q4)Application of SQLlite?

1. Mobile Applications
SQLite is often used in mobile apps (on iOS and Android) because it is small, fast, and doesn't 
require a separate server to manage. Mobile apps can use it to store user data, app preferences, or offline data.

2. Embedded Systems.
SQLite is commonly found in embedded systems where resources like memory and storage are limited. 
Examples include smart home devices, IoT (Internet of Things) devices, and hardware like routers or cameras that need local storage.

3. Desktop Applications
SQLite is a popular choice for desktop applications that require local data storage. Many productivity applications, 
such as note-taking apps or personal finance software, use SQLite for managing data locally

4. Web Browsers
Browsers like Firefox and Chrome use SQLite to store local data like browsing history, bookmarks, and other metadata on the user’s device.

5. Cache Storage
Websites and applications sometimes use SQLite to store temporary data (such as images, scripts, or other files) 
for offline use or for faster access when the data is needed again.

6. Gaming
Some video games or game engines use SQLite to manage game data such as scores, user settings, 
and other persistent data due to its quick setup and minimal resource usage.
